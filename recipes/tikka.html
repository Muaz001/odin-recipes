        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, paprika or Kashmiri red chili powder, ground black pepper, garam masala, and salt. Mix well to form a smooth marinade.</li>
                    <li>Add the bite-sized chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the chicken to tenderize.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Prepare the Skewers:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent them from burning during grilling.</li>
                    <li>Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto the skewers, leaving a little space between each piece for even cooking.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Preheat the Grill:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using an oven, preheat it to the highest broil setting.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Grill the Chicken:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a charred, slightly crispy exterior. If using an oven, place the skewers on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and broil for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Serve:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken tikka skewers from the grill or oven.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves (cilantro) and serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
                </ol>
                
            Chicken tikka is typically enjoyed as an appetizer or served with naan bread, rice, or a side salad. Enjoy the delicious flavors of homemade chicken tikka!
