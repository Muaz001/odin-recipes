        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Nihari is a rich and aromatic slow-cooked stew cherished in South Asian cuisine. It features tender chunks of beef or lamb simmered in a flavorful gravy infused with a blend of fragrant spices like coriander, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon.
        </p>
        <p>
            What sets Nihari apart is its slow-cooking process, allowing the meat to tenderize and soak up the spices' essence over hours of gentle simmering. Served hot and garnished with fresh coriander, sliced ginger, and a squeeze of lemon, Nihari is a comforting delight often enjoyed with naan or rice. It's a culinary indulgence that promises warmth and flavor in every spoonful.

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>  
            <li>Prepare the Meat:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse the beef pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the beef pieces to the pot and sear them until they are browned on all sides. This helps to seal in the juices and adds flavor to the dish. Once browned, remove the beef from the pot and set it aside.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Prepare the Spices and Onions:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the same pot, add the remaining ghee or oil if needed.</li>
                    <li>Add the thinly sliced onions to the pot and cook them until they are soft and golden brown, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</li>
                    <li>Once the onions are caramelized, add the ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell of ginger and garlic disappears.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Add Spices and Flour:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick to the pot. Stir well to coat the onions and spices.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the wheat flour or all-purpose flour over the onion and spice mixture. Stir continuously and cook for 2-3 minutes to toast the flour and remove the raw taste.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Cook the Beef:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Return the browned beef pieces to the pot and mix well with the spice mixture.</li>
                    <li>Add enough warm water to cover the beef completely. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer gently for 2-3 hours, or until the beef is tender and the flavors have melded together. Alternatively, if using a pressure cooker, cook for about 30-40 minutes or according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                </ol>    

            <li>Adjust Consistency and Seasoning:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once the beef is cooked, check the consistency of the nehari. If it is too thin, you can thicken it by mixing wheat flour or cornstarch with water to form a slurry and adding it to the pot. Cook for a few more minutes until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
                    <li>Taste the nehari and adjust the seasoning with salt and additional spices if needed, according to your taste preferences.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Serve:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Garnish the beef nehari with fresh coriander leaves, sliced ginger, and lemon wedges.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with naan bread, roti, or steamed rice. Enjoy the rich and flavorful beef nehari!</li>
