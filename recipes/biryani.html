        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preparation of rice:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add whole spices (cinnamon sticks, cloves, cardamom pods, bay leaves) and salt.</li>
                    <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook until the rice is about 70-80% done. It should still have a slight bite to it. Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Marinating the Chicken:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala (if using), salt, and lemon juice. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or preferably refrigerate it for a few hours for the flavors to meld.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Frying Onions:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add thinly sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove the fried onions from the pan and set them aside.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Cooking the Chicken:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the same pan used for frying onions, add a bit more oil if needed. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated chicken along with the marinade to the pan. Cook over medium heat until the chicken is partially cooked and the masala is well blended.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Layering the Biryani:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or a deep baking dish, spread a layer of cooked rice evenly at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Spread a layer of cooked chicken over the rice. Sprinkle some chopped cilantro and mint leaves, fried onions, and optionally, a pinch of biryani masala.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers until all the rice and chicken are used up, ending with a layer of rice on top. Drizzle saffron-infused milk and melted ghee or butter over the rice.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Dum Cooking (Steaming):</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with dough to ensure steam doesn't escape.</li>
                    <li>Place the pot on a tawa (griddle) or on low heat and let it cook on dum (steam) for about 15-20 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the rice to fully cook.</li>
                </ol>

            <li>Serve:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once done, remove the lid carefully. Gently fluff up the biryani with a fork to mix the layers.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot, garnished with more fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves. Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani!</li>
